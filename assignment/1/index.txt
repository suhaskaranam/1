
Flexbox

Flexbox is primarily designed for one-dimensional layouts, focusing on distributing space and aligning items
along a single axis (either horizontally or vertically). It's best suited for layouts where you have a row or column
of items, such as navigation menus, card-based designs, or centering content within a container.


CSS Grid

CSS Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts, allowing you to define both rows and columns. It creates a
grid of cells where content can be placed in any cell or span across multiple cells. CSS Grid is ideal for complex
grid-based designs like magazine layouts, forms, and any layout where content needs to be placed in a precise
grid structure.
